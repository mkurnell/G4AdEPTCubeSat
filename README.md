# G4AdEPTCubeSat
A Geant4 simulation of the AdEPT CubeSat instrumentation.

# *** Current Issues ***
-No data acquisition events. Need to output to a file. Code exists for this, it just needs modification. 
-Source needs to be made isotropic. All particles are currently arriving from directly above the detector.
-Visualizer will not accept the run/numberofthreads 8 argument.
